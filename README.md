## Introduction

**Sales Warehouse Selector** is a custom ERPNext app designed to improve the Sales Invoice and Sales Order workflow.

By default, ERPNext automatically selects a warehouse when an item is added. In real-world usage, items are often available in multiple warehouses, and users must manually check stock and change the warehouse every time.

This app solves that problem.

When an item is selected in a Sales Invoice or Sales Order, a popup appears showing all warehouses where the item is available along with their stock quantity. The warehouse with the highest stock is clearly marked as **Recommended**, and users can select the desired warehouse with a single click.

The result is a faster, cleaner, and more reliable workflow.

5. The recommended warehouse is highlighted.
6. User clicks **Use** on any warehouse.
7. The warehouse field is set instantly for that item row.

## Installation

Make sure you already have a working Frappe site with ERPNext installed.

### Step 1. Download the app

1.  Download the app using the Bench CLI.

    ```bash
    bench get-app --branch [branch name] https://github.com/murtaza-ghadiali/sales_warehouse_selector.git
    ```

Replace `[branch name]` with the branch that you're using for Frappe Framework, ERPNext.
If it isn't specified, the `--branch` option will default to **develop**.

2.  Install the app on your site.
